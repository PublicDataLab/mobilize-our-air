## From Save Our Air to Mobilizing Our Air<
          
Save Our Air is an experiment funded by OrganiCity and developed by the Public Data Lab. The partnership is characterized by a multidisciplinary composition to provide the knowledge needed in the creation of data-stories. Three projects evolved out of the Save Our Air experiment, Mobilizing Our Air being one of them.

### Mobilizing Our Air’s Vision

The platform strives to: 1. support local activist groups to connect with each other through visibility on the platform, 2. inform individuals interested in activism about activist groups in their vicinity and invites them to join the movements, 3. Bring the topic of air pollution to other activist groups’ attention which already support the cause of better air quality (i.e. bicycle groups), however without openly promoting it.

### The People behind Mobilizing Our Air
  
Mobilizing Our Air was developed and coordinated by the following members:

* Ángeles Briones, DensityDesign Lab - Politecnico di Milano
* Verena Rauchenwald, Gehl
* Daniel Bach, Aalborg University Copenhagen
